## Repository Map

A full codemap is available at `codemap.md` in the project root.

Before working on any task, read `codemap.md` to understand:
- Project architecture and entry points
- Directory responsibilities and design patterns
- Data flow and integration points between modules

For deep work on a specific folder, also read that folder's `codemap.md`.

## Catalog Direction

Catalog v2 is legacy and exists only for old app versions/fallback compatibility.
For new work, migrations, and Control Center UI, do not optimize for v2 behavior.
Use catalog v3 (`thumbnail`, `spritesheet`, paginated pages, and search index) as the source of truth.

## Logging for Fast DX

When working on desktop UI, renderer, IPC, catalog, plugin, or pet-window behavior, add targeted logging as part of the implementation when it helps diagnose issues quickly.
Prefer concise, scoped logs that capture data shape, selected IDs, load/error states, and boundary decisions.
Route renderer diagnostics into the app log when possible so failures are visible in `openpets.log`, not only DevTools.
Avoid noisy permanent logs, secrets, full payload dumps, or logging in tight animation/render loops.

## Control Center CSP

When adding any renderer-visible URL scheme, image source, dev server endpoint, or internal protocol, update the Control Center CSP in both `apps/desktop/vite.config.ts` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html`.
Common pet image protocols include `openpets-codex:`, `openpets-installed:`, and `openpets-pet-preview:`; forgetting CSP causes images to load as the default/fallback pet even when install/render logic is correct.
