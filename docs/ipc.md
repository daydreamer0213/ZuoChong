# Local IPC Protocol & Client

Everything an agent does to a pet travels over a **local IPC channel** between
the agent-side code and the desktop app. The wire contract is defined by
`@open-pets/client` (`packages/client/`) and served by the desktop's
`local-ipc.ts`. This doc explains the transport, the discovery handshake, the
lease model, and the request surface. It is the contract both sides must agree
on; the client package is the source of truth for exact shapes.

Source maps: `packages/client/src/codemap.md` (client),
`apps/desktop/src/codemap.md` (server side: `local-ipc*.ts`, `lease-manager.ts`).

## Why local IPC and not HTTP

The pet app is a local companion. Commands are tiny, frequent, and must never
leave the machine. A local socket gives low latency, no network exposure, and a
natural place to enforce trust (a token + a private endpoint). The protocol is a
**line-delimited JSON** request/response over a single connection per call.

## Transports

The client and server pick a transport per platform:

- **Unix domain socket** — macOS and Linux.
- **Windows named pipe** — Windows.
- **TCP (IPv4)** — used for cross-platform/WSL: a WSL client connects to the
  Windows desktop app over a private IP.

TCP is the one that touches the network, so it is locked down (see Security).

## Discovery handshake

The app writes a **discovery file** at a platform-specific path
(`local-ipc-paths.ts` on the server, `discovery.ts` on the client). The file
contains the endpoint to connect to and an auth **token**. A client:

1. Reads and validates the discovery file (size, permissions, symlink checks;
   on Linux, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` must be `0o700` and owned by the user).
2. Parses + validates the endpoint (`parseIpcEndpoint` / `validateEndpoint`).
3. Opens a connection and sends a request carrying the token.

If the file is missing or the app is down, the client fails fast — integrations
treat the app as "unavailable" and degrade gracefully rather than blocking the
agent.

## Protocol shape

Defined in `protocol.ts` (client) and `local-ipc-protocol.ts` (server):

- Protocol **version** `v1`, validated on both ends.
- A message is one JSON object terminated by `\n`. Max message size **16KB**.
- Timeouts: ~2s to connect, ~3s for a response.
- Requests carry `{ id, version, token, method, params }`.
- Responses are a discriminated union on `ok`: `{ ok: true, ... }` or
  `{ ok: false, error, code }`. The client raises a typed `OpenPetsClientError`
  with an error code on failure.

The client factory `createOpenPetsClient(options)` exposes the high-level
methods; `sendRequest()` is the low-level escape hatch. Result parsers validate
shapes before returning.

## Request surface

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `hello` | Handshake / liveness probe |
| `status` | App + pet status snapshot |
| `pets.list` | Installed pets |
| `pets.install` | Install a catalog pet through the running app |
| `pet.react` | Set a pet reaction (animation state) |
| `pet.say` | Show a speech bubble on a pet |
| `lease.acquire` / `lease.heartbeat` / `lease.release` | Manage a pet lease |

Client method names (`hello()`, `status()`, `listPets()`, `installPet()`,
`acquireLease()`, `heartbeatLease()`, `releaseLease()`, `react()`, `say()`) wrap
these. `react()`/`say()` accept an optional `leaseId` to target a specific pet.

## The lease model

Leases are how multiple agents and the default pet coexist without fighting over
one window. The model (server side in `lease-manager.ts`):

- A lease is a short-lived claim with a **15s TTL**, kept alive by heartbeats.
- `resolveTarget()` decides whether a command hits the **default pet** or an
  **explicit agent pet**.
- **Re-acquiring is idempotent per client.** When a client process re-acquires
  while it still holds a live lease, the manager refreshes that existing lease
  (same `leaseId`, same target) instead of resolving a new target. This stops a
  transient heartbeat lapse from silently *downgrading* an explicit agent pet to
  the default pet on the next acquire. Client identity is the **client PID plus a
  per-process `sessionNonce`** (a random id minted once per client process), so a
  recycled PID belonging to a brand-new process is treated as a distinct session
  and gets its own pet rather than inheriting the previous session's lease. On
  reuse the manager also re-validates that the held target is still eligible; if
  it is not (for example the pet was uninstalled or went broken), it releases the
  stale lease and resolves a fresh target instead of handing back an unavailable
  pet.
- The **first** explicit lease for a pet triggers `showAgentPet()`; the **last**
  explicit lease released triggers `closeAgentPetIfOpen()`. So agent pets appear
  on demand and disappear when their agents are done.
- **Liveness reclaims dead sessions.** A periodic check releases a lease once its
  owning process is gone, probing the **terminal owner PID** (when known) as well
  as the client PID — so a lease can't outlive its session even when the client
  process is orphaned but still alive.
- The default pet is persistent and not lease-bound.

Integrations follow a consistent pattern: acquire a lease on first activity,
heartbeat on an interval (the MCP server uses ~5s; OpenCode renews with a ~2s
buffer before expiry), and release on shutdown. If a heartbeat fails, an
integration first stashes the stale `leaseId` and retries `lease.heartbeat` to
restore it before falling back to a fresh `lease.acquire`, so a dropped heartbeat
never re-routes an agent pet onto the default. The MCP server additionally
releases its lease and exits **exactly once** when its stdio transport closes (or
on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`), so the pet tears down promptly when the session ends and
the shutdown path never runs twice. Failures are swallowed so the agent is never
blocked by pet IPC.

See [pets.md](pets.md) for what happens once a command reaches a pet window, and
[agent-integrations.md](agent-integrations.md) for how each integration drives
this surface.

## Reaction validation

Reactions are a closed enum. The client validates a reaction against the allowed
set before sending, and `@open-pets/agent-events` validates *speech* strings
(single line, length-bounded, no code/URLs/paths/secrets) so nothing unsafe ever
reaches a bubble. See [agent-integrations.md](agent-integrations.md).

## Security

- **Token auth** on every request; the token comes only from the discovery file,
  which is permission-checked.
- **TCP is private-only.** IPv4 addresses only (no hostnames); allowed ranges are
  loopback `127.0.0.0/8`, private `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, and
  link-local `169.254/16`. `0.0.0.0`, public IPs, and hostnames are rejected.
  This is exactly enough to let a WSL client reach the Windows host and nothing
  more.
- **Size + timeout caps** bound resource use and protect against malformed input.

## Contracts

- `packages/client/contracts/client-protocol.contract.ts` — client-side protocol
  validation.
- `apps/desktop/contracts/local-ipc-protocol.contract.ts` — server-side
  request/response parsing.

These run in the test suite ([testing-and-validation.md](testing-and-validation.md))
and are the guardrail against protocol drift between client and app.
